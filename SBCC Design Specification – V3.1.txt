OVERVIEW: WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHY
The Santa Barbara Chef Collective (SBCC) represents a new model for delivering extraordinary private culinary experiences. We connect discerning clients with handpicked local chefs, backed by a robust tech-powered platform that scales personalization, hospitality, and operational flow. Whether clients are planning milestone events or seeking weekly nourishment, we tailor every touchpoint—from inquiry to curated menu to chef assignment—to elevate the experience.
What Sets SBCC Apart:
* A client-first journey: Guests are guided into the right flow—event planning, weekly meals, or chef discovery—right from the start.

* Smart form logic connects users to just 3–4 ideal menus, not an overwhelming archive.

* Elegant design meets flexible, Airtable-powered content management.

* Chef bios and menus are deeply integrated and dynamic.

* Automated Dubsado logging (simulated for now) prepares for CRM integration and invoicing.

This system is not only powerful—it’s replicable. Once tested and refined in Santa Barbara, it can scale to serve other high-net-worth communities (e.g., Napa, Aspen, Hamptons, Maui) using the same architecture, brand framework, and local chef partnerships.
The following document outlines the full experience, design, and technical requirements in a fully comprehensive format, including all field names, user flow logic, and integration structure. Ready for CURSOR implementation.

Home Page Instructions for CURSOR
________________


1. Header Section
   * Logo Placement:

      * Place the Santa Barbara Chef Collective logo on the left side of the header.

      * Ensure the logo is clean and high-res.

         * Text:

            * Next to the logo (on the right side), place the text: "Santa Barbara Chef Collective"

            * Below the text, add the tagline: "Handpicked Talent. Personal Touch. Unforgettable Experiences."

            * Ensure the font for the name is Playfair Display and the tagline is in a lighter weight (e.g., italicized, but still readable).

            * Keep the header area clean and minimal, ensuring it doesn’t overwhelm the page content.

2. Hero Section
               * Background Image: Use S021 from the Images DB or a similar high-quality image that conveys SBCC’s elegant yet personal approach. It should be full-screen and provide a warm, inviting vibe.

               * Text Overlay:

                  * Heading: "Welcome to Santa Barbara Chef Collective"

                  * Subheading: "Where culinary artistry meets personalized hospitality."

3. Footer Section

Footer Design Considerations:
                                                               * Ensure the footer is fixed at the bottom of the screen (on desktop and mobile).

                                                               * The overall look should fit seamlessly with the rest of the page and be clean and minimalist.

                                                               * The form fields should have sufficient padding, be visually aligned, and be easy to interact with on both desktop and mobile devices.

STEP 3: Dish Selection Page

                                                                                                         * Guest Count Tier (e.g., 4–7, 8–12, 12+)

                                                                                                            * Premium Items: Callout shown but pricing not calculated yet (future update)

PRICING LOGIC – STRUCTURE & RULES
