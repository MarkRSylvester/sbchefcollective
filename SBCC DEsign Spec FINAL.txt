Santa Barbara Chef Collective Website Design Document – V3.1 (Full Technical Handoff)
________________


OVERVIEW: WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHY
The Santa Barbara Chef Collective (SBCC) represents a new model for delivering extraordinary private culinary experiences. We connect discerning clients with handpicked local chefs, backed by a robust tech-powered platform that scales personalization, hospitality, and operational flow. Whether clients are planning milestone events or seeking weekly nourishment, we tailor every touchpoint—from inquiry to curated menu to chef assignment—to elevate the experience.
What Sets SBCC Apart:
* A client-first journey: Guests are guided into the right flow—event planning, weekly meals, or chef discovery—right from the start.

* Smart form logic connects users to just 3–4 ideal menus, not an overwhelming archive.

* Elegant design meets flexible, Airtable-powered content management.

* Chef bios and menus are deeply integrated and dynamic.

* Automated Dubsado logging (simulated for now) prepares for CRM integration and invoicing.

This system is not only powerful—it’s replicable. Once tested and refined in Santa Barbara, it can scale to serve other high-net-worth communities (e.g., Napa, Aspen, Hamptons, Maui) using the same architecture, brand framework, and local chef partnerships.
The following document outlines the full experience, design, and technical requirements in a fully comprehensive format, including all field names, user flow logic, and integration structure. Ready for CURSOR implementation.

                  * On submit, user is routed to Menu Suggestions view

STEP 2: Menu Curation Logic
                     * Show 3–4 menus using match logic:

                        * Event Type match (required)

                                 * All dishes are pulled from Airtable Dishes where Menu ID matches selected Menu

Logic:
                                    * Minimum required: 1 dish per category (validation at submission)

                                    * Premium items flagged via field Is Premium? (Boolean)

                                    * Dishes grouped by category with checkboxes

                                    * Checkbox color = left border color from menu color tag

STEP 4: Pricing Recap Page
                                       * Pull Menu Tier from selected Menu (e.g., Casual, Gourmet, Chef’s Table)

                                       * Use Guest Count from form submission

                                       * Base pricing range shown based on:

                                          * Menu Tier

                                          * Guest Count Tier (e.g., 4–7, 8–12, 12+)

                                             * Premium Items: Callout shown but pricing not calculated yet (future update)

STEP 5: Management Review
                                                * In Airtable:

                                                   * Record status set to Awaiting Chef

                                                   * Chef is selected manually by staff using availability calendar

                                                   * Assigned Chef field is updated

STEP 6: Client Confirmation
                                                      * PDF Menu is auto-generated using:

                                                         * Selected menu name

PRICING LOGIC – STRUCTURE & RULES
Used during the dev and staging phase to simulate Dubsado API interaction without affecting the live system. Allows safe logging of all form submissions, project sync attempts, and invoice triggers.
Pricing at SBCC is designed to be flexible, menu-driven, and scalable. The pricing logic must account for base tiers, guest count, premium upgrades, and optional enhancements.
1. Menu Tiers (Defined in Menus Table)
                                                                                                                           * Intimate Gathering (4–7 guests)

                                                                                                                              * Casual: $130–$165 per person

                                                                                                                              * Gourmet: $170–$200 per person

                                                                                                                              * Chef’s Table: $210+ per person

                                                                                                                                 * Group (8+ guests)

                                                                                                                                    * Casual: $130–$165 per person

                                                                                                                                    * Gourmet: $170–$200 per person

                                                                                                                                    * Chef’s Table: $210+ per person

Each Menu record contains a Tier field which determines this range.
2. Guest Count-Based Logic
                                                                                                                                       * Guest Count from form determines which pricing band to apply.

                                                                                                                                       * Special pricing note: Groups over 12 may require a custom quote.

3. Premium Item Logic (Future Phase)
                                                                                                                                          * Each Dish has a Is Premium? checkbox field.

                                                                                                                                          * Premium items may:

                                                                                                                                             * Add $X per person

                                                                                                                                             * Or trigger an upcharge alert (e.g., lobster, caviar, extra desserts)

                                                                                                                                                * For now, show alert/flag without calculation. Future version may apply pricing formula.

4. Optional Enhancements (From Services Table)
                                                                                                                                                   * Each service marked Enhancement = Yes may include a Base Cost, Per Guest Cost, or Custom Quote flag.

                                                                                                                                                   * Enhancements are optional and may be added to pricing recap in UJ1 flow.

5. Weekly Meal Pricing (Simplified)
                                                                                                                                                      * Hourly rate: $65–$120 per hour

                                                                                                                                                      * Groceries charged separately

                                                                                                                                                      * No per-dish pricing logic needed for UJ2

                                                                                                                                                         * Show base range (e.g., “$130–165 per guest”)

                                                                                                                                                         * Alert for premium items: “This menu includes premium ingredients. Final quote will reflect this.”
